title: "SBI Automate for Bank"
description: "<ul><li>Design of a secure mobile banking application for State Bank of India that includes enhanced login via face recognition, a feature to scan and submit mandate forms/cheques with automatic signature matching and verification.</li><li>Login was supported by a simple CNN tuned to detect faces in the wild and then compare the face embedding with the ones stored in the bank database for similarity.</li><li>Document processing was achieved through a smart cropping system with the help of OpenCV correcting for geometric distortions or deformations and edge/contour detection.</li><li>Same was followed by localization of regions of interest in the document and extracting essential information like the MICR code, amount, payee details and signature.</li><li>A convolutional Siamese Network provided the best results when tested for signature comparison and verification for features like dimension ratio and signature density.</li></ul>"
