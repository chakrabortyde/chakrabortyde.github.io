title: "Traffic Sign Detection"
description: "<ul><li>Can detect and recognize all mandatory traffic signs and most cautionary signs in video sequences recorded by an onboard vehicle camera using the OpenCV cascade of classifiers.</li><li>Solution was implemented for use on a daily basis which aided a lot of people using it, who often became confused with the minuscule changes of signs all over a diverse country such as India, particularly tending to the elderly and specially-abled, easing their driving experience.</li><li>A vehicle speed checking mechanism was also added later on to the system which dramatically reduced if not prevented speed violations, for streets where the speed limit information was not available digitally, such as on Google Maps.</li></ul>"
