{% include base_path %}

I'm a tech enthusiast who enjoys learning about coding, data, and AI. With a Master's degree in Computer Science from Northeastern University and a knack for problem-solving, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of exciting projects.

During my time at UBS in Chicago, I was able to experiment with numbers and create cool tools to help investors make better decisions. And, as a TA at Northeastern, I got to share my love of coding with a group of eager students, which was always a lot of fun! Back in my hometown in India, I began my career as a Software Engineer with TCS. From developing conversational AI to migrating old-school platforms to the cloud, I got to wear many hats and learn a lot along the way.

But it isn't just about work! I'm also a robotics geek. Remember line-following robots? Yes, I helped build one during my time at IIT Guwahati Techniche. When I'm not glued to a screen, you can find me exploring the outdoors, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, or simply relaxing with a good book. Life is all about balance, right?

So that's me in a nutshell: always curious, always learning, and always ready for a challenge. Let us connect and geek out together!
