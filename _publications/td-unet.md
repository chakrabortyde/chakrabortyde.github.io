title: "Multimodal Segmentation of Brain Tumours in Volumetric MRI Scans of the Brain Using Time-Distributed U-Net"
abstract: "Brain tumour segmentation poses a challenging task even in the eyes of a trained medical practitioner. Traditional machine learning algorithms require hand-coding features from images before they can learn to identify the regions. Deep learning can solve the problem of detecting tumours with precision and even segment it. Neural networks can learn a hierarchical representation of features from the data by itself. We use a time-distributed architecture for U-Net based deep convolutional neural networks (TD-UNET). We tested our network against the MICCAI BRATS 2015 dataset that comprised 220 high-graded gliomas (HGG) and 54 low-graded gliomas (LGG) and yielded a test case accuracy of 58.3%."
