title: "Screening Mammography Breast Cancer Detection"
abstract: "Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths, but current programs are expensive and prone to false positives, leading to unnecessary follow-up and patient anxiety. This paper proposes a solution to automated breast cancer detection, to improve the efficiency and accuracy of screening programs. Different methodologies were tested against the RSNA dataset of radiographic breast images of roughly 20,000 female patients and yielded an average validation case pF1 score of 0.56 across methods."
